LeetCode 0011: Container With Most Water

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum area of water that the container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The vertical lines are at indices 0 and 1. Line at 0 has height 1, line at 1 has height 8.
The area = min(1, 8) * (1 - 0) = 1 * 1 = 1. But the maximum is at indices 1 and 8 with heights 8 and 7.
Area = min(8, 7) * (8 - 1) = 7 * 7 = 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4

    Why two pointers works:
