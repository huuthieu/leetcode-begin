LeetCode 207: Course Schedule

Problem:
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1.
You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must
take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1] indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

This is a cycle detection problem in a directed graph (topological sort).

Example:
numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true (You can finish course 1 first, then course 0)

numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false (There's a cycle: 0 -> 1 -> 0)

Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V = numCourses, E = len(prerequisites)
Space Complexity: O(V + E) for graph
