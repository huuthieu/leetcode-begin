LeetCode 206: Reverse Linked List

Problem:
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Input: head = []
Output: []

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) for iterative, O(n) for recursive (call stack)
