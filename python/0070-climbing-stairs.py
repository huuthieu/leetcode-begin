LeetCode 70: Climbing Stairs

Problem:
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example:
n = 2 => 2 ways (1+1, 2)
n = 3 => 3 ways (1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1)
n = 4 => 5 ways (1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+2+1, 2+1+1, 2+2)
n = 5 => 8 ways

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) - with memoization or O(1) - optimized with two variables
