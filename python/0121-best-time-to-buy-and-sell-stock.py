LeetCode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Problem:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and a different day
in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example:
prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] => 5 (buy at 1, sell at 6)
prices = [7,6,4,3,2,1] => 0 (no transaction)
prices = [2,4,1] => 2 (buy at 2, sell at 4)

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
